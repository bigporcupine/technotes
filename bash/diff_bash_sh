In writing linux script, we usually have following as the first line to indicate system using what shell to interpret 

#!/bin/sh

it always works, until it didn't for below script
if [ "aa" == "aa" ]
then
   echo "yes"
fi

error message:
[: aa: unexpected operator

The story is the writing /bin/sh and /bin/bash is not always identical. Actually /bin/sh is a link to (usually) either /bin/bash
or /bin/dash.

Use ls -al /bin/sh to see what shell it points to.

note: sh is a programming language specification defined by POXIS, with variant implementation: 
Try watching /etc/lsb-release /etc/redhat-release /etc/os-release ... to know which linux derivation you are using (BSD/Ubuntu ..)
 bash -- redhat??
 dash -- Modern Debian and Ubuntu systems
 ksh -- BSD, OpenBSD
