Plugin that enable your command output to vim "quick fix" window just like vim ":make" command, it's useful because you
are not always type ":make" to build your project

https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch

How to install:
  cd ~/.vim/bundle
  git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch.git
  
Short Cuts:
  1)Foreground build
     :Make
  2)Background build
    :Make!
  3) open quickfix window manually
    :Copen
    
    if the build succeed in background build (see 2)), the quick fix window won't appear, use ":Copen" to deliberately open it
  4) switch other compiler than "make"
    :Dispatch myBuildTool /tmp/test.cpp
    :Dispatch myBuildTool %          ---- '%' here means current file name
